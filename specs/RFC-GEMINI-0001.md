## Abstract
Gemini™ defines a foundational protocol architecture for building edge-deployable, multimodal, autonomous agent systems with native support for swarm intelligence and decentralized memory.

---

## Purpose
To establish a common reference protocol enabling interoperability between AI agents operating under resource-constrained, offline, or modular system environments.

---

## Key Components
- Multimodal integration: vision, language, audio, and action
- Agent Spawning™ with role-defined task delegation
- Memetic Kernel™ persistent memory core
- Decentralized local inference + modular execution stacks
- Gemini v1.0 JSON-based schema and API

---

## Compliance
To qualify for Gemini™ compliance, implementations must:
1. Support at least 3 agent roles (e.g., planner, actor, memory unit)
2. Operate independently of continuous cloud access
3. Include version-tagged protocol headers in data exchange

## Licensing
Use of the Gemini™ mark or protocol name in commercial software requires licensing through Empire Bridge Media Inc.
