# RFC-GEMINI-0001

**Title:** Geminiâ„¢ Protocol for Agentic Cognition and Swarm Autonomy  
**Author:** Empire Bridge Media Inc.  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-27

## Abstract

Geminiâ„¢ defines a foundational AI protocol for building edge-deployable, multimodal, and autonomous agent systems with native support for agent swarming, memetic memory, and decentralized cognition. The protocol is optimized for offline, local, or modular environments and offers a reference foundation for next-generation agentic infrastructure.

---

## Purpose

To establish a standardized framework for interoperability between AI agents operating across diverse environmentsâ€”particularly those requiring low-latency local inference, offline deployment, and adaptive role-based collaboration.

---

## Key Components

- **Multimodal Integration**: Vision, language, audio, and action modalities  
- **Agent Spawningâ„¢**: Role-based task delegation and self-replicating agent instances  
- **Memetic Kernelâ„¢**: Persistent, belief-weighted memory and stateful cognition  
- **Decentralized Autonomy**: Local inference with modular, stackable execution units  
- **Edge Compatibility**: Designed for deployment on low-power, resource-constrained devices  
- **Gemini v1.0 Schema**: Reference JSON schema and API definition for system orchestration  

---

## Protocol Overview

The Geminiâ„¢ protocol is composed of three architectural layers:

1. **Agent Layer**  
   - Agent roles: Planner, Executor, Observer, Communicator  
   - Internal system prompts and memory stacks  
   - Role-to-role delegation rules

2. **Coordination Layer**  
   - Agent Swarm Bus (ASB): Inter-agent communication protocol  
   - Role arbitration + dynamic task mapping  
   - Fallback consensus triggers

3. **Memory Layer**  
   - Memetic Kernelâ„¢ format (belief, weight, source, decay)  
   - Local embedding database and replay buffer  
   - Long-term memory access control rules

## Versioning

- `v1.0`: Initial public draft  
- Future updates will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)  
- RFC updates and extensions will use sequential numbers (e.g., RFC-GEMINI-0002.md)
