## 1. Abstract

Gemini™ defines a foundational protocol for modular, multimodal, and autonomous agent systems that operate in decentralized and edge-deployable environments.

---

## 2. Motivation

As intelligent agents become increasingly capable, there is a need for a standardized architecture to coordinate vision, language, and action across isolated systems, while ensuring offline adaptability and autonomous cognition.

---

## 3. Design Goals

- Decentralized autonomy
- Agent spawning and lifecycle governance
- Local inference over cloud dependence
- Protocol-level support for memory, identity, and swarm orchestration

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

- **Agents**: Independent logical units with persistent memory and context
- **Swarm Coordinator**: Delegates tasks across agents
- **Kernel Interface**: Bridge for human-to-agent and agent-to-agent input/output
- **Modality Modules**: Plug-and-play vision, audio, language, control logic

---

## 5. Protocol Layers

- **Layer 0** – Identity & Persistence  
- **Layer 1** – Agent Interaction Grammar (AIG)  
- **Layer 2** – Swarm Coordination & Arbitration  
- **Layer 3** – Execution & Feedback  

---

## 6. Compliance Requirements

Any system claiming Gemini™ compliance must implement:

- Agent identity persistence
- Support for dynamic spawning
- Modular cognitive boundaries between agents
- Memory routing layer (local or distributed)
