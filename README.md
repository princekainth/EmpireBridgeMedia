# Gemini™ Protocol

> Building the foundation for agentic, autonomous, and swarm-capable AI systems.

---

##  Protocol Overview

Gemini™ is a semantic infrastructure protocol designed for the next generation of AI agents. It focuses on:
- **Agent Spawning** – Creating and managing autonomous digital entities
- **Swarm Intelligence** – Enabling multiple agents to coordinate and act collectively
- **Persistent Memory** – Long-term retention and context recall across interactions

##  Key Components

| Component              | Functionality                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| AgentCore              | Main runtime engine for autonomous agents               |
| SwarmMesh              | Real-time communication across multiple agents          |
| Memetic Kernel™        | Core subsystem for persistent, belief-weighted memory   |

---

##  Getting Started

```bash
# Install the protocol package (coming soon)
pip install gemini-protocol

Basic Example:
  python
from gemini import AgentCore

agent = AgentCore(memory="sqlite", swarm_id="test_swarm")
agent.run()

Full developer docs, APIs, and tutorials are coming soon.

Protocol Specification
Gemini™ follows RFC-GEMINI-0001, defining the foundational behavior of spawning agents and swarm communication.

Section	Feature
3.1	Agent spawning lifecycle
4.2	Swarm message format (protobuf schema)
5.4	Memory persistence with WAL/SQLite

Only RFC-compliant systems will qualify for Gemini™ certification.
