# Gemini™ Protocol

> Building the foundation for agentic, autonomous, and swarm-capable AI systems.

---

##  Protocol Overview

Gemini™ is a semantic infrastructure protocol designed for the next generation of AI agents. It focuses on:
- **Agent Spawning** – Creating and managing autonomous digital entities
- **Swarm Intelligence** – Enabling multiple agents to coordinate and act collectively
- **Persistent Memory** – Long-term retention and context recall across interactions

##  Key Components

| Component              | Functionality                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| AgentCore              | Main runtime engine for autonomous agents               |
| SwarmMesh              | Real-time communication across multiple agents          |
| Memetic Kernel™        | Core subsystem for persistent, belief-weighted memory   |

---
## Getting Started

### Install the protocol package (coming soon)

```bash
pip install gemini-protocol

Basic Example

from gemini import AgentCore

agent = AgentCore(memory="sqlite", swarm_id="test_swarm")
agent.run()

```
Full developer docs, APIs, and tutorials are coming soon.

##  Protocol Specification

Gemini™ follows `RFC-GEMINI-0001`, defining the foundational behavior of spawning agents and swarm communication.

### RFC Overview

| Section | Feature Description                                      |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.1     | Agent spawning lifecycle (fork, exec, terminate)         |
| 4.2     | Swarm message format (Protobuf schema)                   |
| 5.4     | Memory persistence with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL/SQLite) |

Only RFC-compliant systems will qualify for official Gemini™ certification.
