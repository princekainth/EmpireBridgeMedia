**Author:** Empire Bridge Media Inc. <legal@ipbridge.co>
**Date:** June 1, 2025
**Status:** Draft for Internal and Public Release
**Type:** Intellectual Property Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction

Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ is strategically building a robust intellectual property portfolio designed to architect the linguistic and operational foundations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Our trademark strategy is a cornerstone of this vision, enabling us to own the conceptual language of AGI, differentiate our brands, and ensure ethical governance through semantic clarity.

## 2. Our Trademark Strategy: Semantic Dominance

We recognize that in the rapidly evolving landscape of AGI, controlling the terminology and foundational concepts is as crucial as owning specific technical implementations. Our trademark strategy aims for **Semantic Dominance**, ensuring that the core components and defining attributes of future AGI systems must engage with our established lexicon.

This approach creates strategic friction for competitors attempting to accurately describe their products or protocols without acknowledging our defined conceptual territory.
