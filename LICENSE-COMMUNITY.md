# Community Engagement Principles for Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ Protocol Evolution

## Preamble

Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ (the "Company") is dedicated to architecting the foundational layers of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through its diverse portfolio of brands, including the **Eidos Protocol™**. Our vision is to establish the "constitution of machine intelligence" that is open yet owned, standardized yet adaptable, and ethical by design. This document outlines the principles for community engagement and contribution to the *evolution of our overarching protocols and conceptual frameworks*.

## 1. Purpose of this Document

This `LICENSE-COMMUNITY.md` serves as a guiding framework for individuals and organizations (collectively, "Contributors") who wish to engage with and contribute to the high-level philosophical, architectural, and governance discussions surrounding Empire Bridge Media Inc.'s™ initiatives and protocols. This document complements, but does not replace, specific code licenses (e.g., MIT License for the Eidos SDK) governing software components.

## 2. Our Core Principles for Community Engagement

* **Open Dialogue:** We encourage open and transparent discussion regarding the evolution of AGI, its ethical implications, and the design of foundational protocols.
* **Value Alignment:** All contributions must align with our commitment to AGI that is beneficial, safe, and aligned with human flourishing as articulated in our **RFC-EBM-0001: Foundational Principles for AGI Governance.**
* **Intellectual Integrity:** We value rigorous thought, innovative ideas, and constructive critique.
* **Respectful Collaboration:** We foster an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are respected and debated constructively.

## 3. Contribution Guidelines (Conceptual & Protocol-Level)

Contributions to the overarching protocol and conceptual frameworks (e.g., new RFC proposals, architectural critiques, ethical framework refinements) should adhere to the following:

* **Clarity:** Ideas must be clearly articulated and well-reasoned.
* **Relevance:** Contributions should directly address the foundational aspects of AGI as per Empire Bridge Media Inc.'s™ vision.
* **Format:** Submissions (e.g., via RFCs in the `rfc/` directory or discussions in designated forums) should follow specified formats where applicable.

## 4. Intellectual Property & Contribution License

By contributing ideas, concepts, architectural designs, or protocol specifications to the Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ collective initiatives (excluding contributions to specific code repositories which are governed by their own licenses, e.g., MIT License for Eidos SDK), Contributors agree to the following terms:

* **Grant of License to Company:** You grant Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contributions.
* **Acknowledgement of Ownership:** You acknowledge that Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ is building a proprietary intellectual property portfolio, including but not limited to the **Eidos Protocol™**, **GEMINI™**, and its associated trademarked terms (e.g., Memetic Kernel™, Agent Spawning™). Contributions to the conceptual framework inherently become part of this collective intellectual property.
* **No Obligation:** Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ is under no obligation to use or incorporate any contribution.
* **No Expectation of Compensation:** Contributions are made on a voluntary basis, and no compensation is expected unless explicitly agreed upon in a separate, written agreement.

## 5. Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising from community contributions or the interpretation of these principles shall be resolved through good-faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes shall be submitted to binding arbitration in  Ontario, Canada under its then-current rules.

## 6. Amendments

This document may be amended by Empire Bridge Media Inc.™ from time to time. Any amendments will be published in this repository, and continued engagement signifies acceptance of the new terms.
